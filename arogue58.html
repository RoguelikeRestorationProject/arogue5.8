<blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p align="justify">Rogue was first introduced by Michael Toy at the 
		University of California at Berkeley as a screen-oriented fantasy game. 
		The game had 26 types of monsters that the player could meet while 
		exploring a dungeon generated by the computer. Scrolls, potions, rings, 
		wands, staves, armor, and weapons helped the player to battle these 
		monsters and to gain gold, the basis for scoring.</p>
		<p align="justify">The version of Rogue described in this guide has been 
		expanded to include over 110 monsters with many new capabilities. Many 
		of the monsters are intelligent, and they, like the player, must avoid 
		traps and decide when it is better to fight or to run. The player 
		chooses a character class at the beginning of the game which defines the 
		player's abilities. Experience, rather than gold, decides the player's 
		score.</p>

<h2 align="justify">&nbsp;</h2>
<h3 align="justify">1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Rogue is a screen-oriented fantasy game set in the ever-changing Dungeons of 
	Doom. The game comes complete with monsters, spells, weapons, armor, 
	potions, and other magical items. The dungeon's geography changes with every 
	game, and although many magical items have certain identifiable properties, 
	such as turning the player invisible, the physical manifestation of the 
	magic changes each game. A red potion, for example, will cause the same 
	reaction throughout a given game, but it may be a completely different 
	potion in a new game.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Entering the dungeon with only a little food, armor, and a weapon, the 
	player must develop a good strategy of when to fight, when to run, and how 
	to best use any magical items found in the dungeon. To make things 
	interesting, the player has a quest to return one of several unique 
	artifacts, rumored to lie deep in the dungeon's bowels. Returning with this 
	artifact brings great glory and the title of Complete Winner. But even after 
	finding the artifact, the player may wish to continue further to match wits 
	with an arch-devil, demon prince, or even a deity found far down in the 
	dungeon. Defeating such a creature will gain the player many experience 
	points, the basis for scoring in Rogue.</p>
<p align="justify">
    It is very difficult to return from the Dungeons of Doom. Few people ever 
	make it out alive. Should this unlikely event occur, the player would be 
	proclaimed a complete winner and handsomely rewarded for any booty removed 
	from the dungeon.</p>
<h3 align="justify">2. CHARACTER CLASSES AND ATTRIBUTES</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Before placing the player in the dungeon, the game requests the player to 
	select a character class: a fighter, a magic user, a cleric, or a thief.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps"><strong>2.1 The Fighter</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify">
    A fighter is very strong and will have a high strength rating. This great 
	strength gives a fighter the best odds of winning a battle with a monster. 
	At high experience levels the fighter also gets to attack multiple times in 
	a single turn. This obviously further increases his chances at winning 
	battles. Intrinsic to the fighter class is a robustness which results in 1 
	to 10 extra hit points for every new experience level.</p>
<p align="justify"><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps"><strong>2.2 The Magician</strong></span></p>
<p align="justify">
    A magician's major attribute is intelligence, which enables the magician to 
	cast spells. The number and variety of spells increases as the magician 
	gains experience and intelligence. Other types of characters can cast 
	spells, but only if they manage to gain extraordinarily high intelligence. 
	Magic users are not as hearty as fighters; they receive 1 to 8 extra hit 
	points for every new experience level.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">2.3 The Cleric</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">
    A cleric has a high wisdom rating and can thus pray. The number and variety 
	of prayers which the gods are willing to grant to a cleric increase as the 
	cleric gains experience and wisdom. Other character types can pray only if 
	they manage to gain extraordinary wisdom.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Because of their religious nature, clerics can also affect the &quot;undead&quot; 
	beings, like zombies and ghouls, which became monsters after they died. If 
	an &quot;undead&quot; creature is next to a cleric, the cleric may try to turn it and 
	cause it to flee. If the cleric is sufficiently powerful relative to the 
	monster, the cleric will destroy it. This ability increases as the character 
	gains experience levels.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Clerics can gain from 1 to 8 extra hit points on reaching a new experience 
	level.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">2.4 The Thief</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">
    A thief is exceptionally dextrous and has a good chance to set a trap or rob 
	a monster. Any type of character can try to set a trap or steal from a 
	monster standing next to the character, but the chances of success are low 
	compared to a thief's chances.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    By their nature, thieves can automatically detect all the gold on the 
	current level of the dungeon. They are also good at detecting hidden traps. 
	Because thieves slink along, they are not as likely as other characters to 
	wake sleeping monsters. If a thief manages to sneak up on a creature without 
	waking it, he will get a chance to backstab the monster. When this is done, 
	the damage done by the thief greatly increases based on his experience 
	level.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Thieves gain from 1 to 6 extra hit points from a new experience level.
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">2.5 
CONSTITUTION</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Every character has a constitution rating. A character with 
an exceptionally good constitution will gain more than the normal amount of hit 
points associated with the character's class when the character reaches a new 
experience level. Exceptional constitution also provides better protection 
versus poison-based attacks and diseases.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">2.6 Experience Levels</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">
    Characters gain experience for killing monsters, stealing from monsters, and 
	turning monsters. Each character class has a set of thresholds associated 
	with it. When a character reaches a threshold, the character attains the 
	next experience level. This new level brings extra hit points and a greater 
	chance of success in performing the abilities associated with the 
	character's class. Magicians receive new spells, and clerics receive new 
	prayers.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Thieves have the lowest threshold for gaining experience levels, followed by 
	clerics. Fighters are next, and magicians have the highest threshold.</p>
<h3 align="justify">
    3. THE SCREEN</h3>
<p align="justify">
    During the normal course of play, the screen consists of three separate 
	sections: the top line of the terminal, the bottom two lines of the 
	terminal, and the remaining middle lines. The top line reports actions which 
	occur during the game, the middle section depicts the dungeon, and the 
	bottom lines describe the player's current condition.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">3.1 The Top Line</span></strong>
<p align="justify">
    Whenever anything happens to the player, such as finding a scroll or hitting 
	or being hit by a monster, a short report of the occurrence appears on the 
	top line of the screen. When such reports occur quickly, one right after 
	another, the game displays the notice followed by the prompt '--More--.' 
	After reading this notice, the player can press a space to display the next 
	message. At such a point, the game ignores all commands until the player 
	presses a space.</p>
<p align="justify">
    <strong>
	<span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">3.2 The Dungeon Section</span></strong>
<p align="justify">
    The large middle section of the screen displays the player's surroundings using 
    the following symbols:

    </table>
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><span style="FONT-VARIANT: small-caps">3.3 The Status Section</span></strong></p>
<p align="justify">
    The bottom two lines of the screen describe the player's current status. The 
    first line gives the player's characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Intelligence (Int)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Strength (Str)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Wisdom (Wis)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Dexterity (Dxt)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Constitution (Const)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Charisma (Char)</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">Encumbrance (Carry)</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
    Intelligence, strength, wisdom, dexterity, and constitution have a normal 
	maximum of 25, but can be higher when augmented by a ring. Encumbrance is a 
	measurement of how much the player can carry versus how much he is currently 
	carrying. The more you carry relative to your maximum causes you to use more 
	food.</p>
<p align="justify">
    The second status line provides the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">The current level (Lvl) in the dungeon. This number 
	increases as the player goes further down.</p>
	<li>
	<p align="justify">How much gold (Au) the player is carrying.</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">The player's current number of hit points (Hp), followed 
	in parentheses by the player's current maximum number of hit points. Hit 
	points express the player's health. As a player heals by resting, the 
	player's current hit points gradually increase until reaching the current 
	maximum. This maximum increases each time a player attains a new experience 
	level. If the player's current hit points reach 0, the player dies.</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">The player's armor class (Ac). This number describes the 
	amount of protection provided by the armor and rings currently worn by the 
	player. Wearing no armor is equivalent to an armor class of 10. The 
	protection level increases as the armor class decreases.</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">The player's current experience level (Exp) followed by 
	the player's experience points. The player can gain experience points by 
	killing monsters, successfully stealing from monsters, and turning monsters. 
	When a player gains enough experience points to surpass a threshold that 
	depends on the player's character type, the player reaches a new experience 
	level. A new experience level brings extra hit points and possibly added 
	abilities, such as a new spell for a magician or a new prayer for a cleric.</p>
    <li>
	<p align="justify">A description of the player's character. This description 
	depends on the player's character type and experience level.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 align="justify">4. COMMANDS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    A player can invoke most Rogue commands by typing a single character. Some 
	commands, however, require a direction, in which case the player types the 
	command character followed by a directional command. Many commands can be 
	prefaced by a number, indicating how many times the command should be 
	executed.</p>
<p align="justify">
    When the player invokes a command referring to an item in the player's pack 
	(such as reading a scroll), the game prompts for the item. The player should 
	then type the letter associated with the item, as displayed by the inventory 
	command. Typing a '*' at this point produces a list of the eligible items.</p>
<p align="center"><b><i>Rogue understands the following commands:</i></b></p>

</p>
<h3 align="justify">5. IMPLICIT COMMANDS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    There is no &quot;attack&quot; command. If a player wishes to attack a monster, the 
	player simply tries to move onto the spot where the monster is standing. The 
	game then assumes that the player wishes to attack the monster with whatever 
	weapon the player is wielding.</p>
<p align="justify">
    When the player moves onto an item, the game automatically places the object 
	into the player's pack. If there is no room left in the pack, the game 
	announces that fact and leaves the item on the floor.</p>
<h3 align="justify">6. LIGHT</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Some rooms in the dungeon possess a natural light source. In other rooms and 
	in corridors the player can see only those things within a one space radius 
	from the player. These dark rooms can be lit with magical light or by a fire 
	beetle.</p>
<h3 align="justify">7. WEAPONS AND ARMOR</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The player can wield exactly one weapon at a time. When the player attacks a 
	monster, the amount of damage depends on the particular weapon the player is 
	wielding. To fire a projectile weapon, such as a crossbow or a short bow, 
	the player should wield the bow and &quot;throw&quot; the bolt or arrow at the 
	monster.</p>
<p align="justify">
    A weapon may be cursed or blessed, affecting the likelihood of hitting a 
	monster with the weapon and the damage the weapon will inflict on the 
	monster. If the player has identified a weapon, the &quot;to hit&quot; and &quot;to damage&quot; 
	bonuses appear in that order before the weapon's name in an inventory 
	listing. A positive bonus indicates a blessed weapon, and a negative bonus 
	usually indicates a cursed weapon. The player cannot release a cursed 
	weapon.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Without any armor the player has an armor class of 10. The lower the 
	player's armor class, the harder it is for a monster to hit the player, so 
	wearing armor can improve the player's armor class. A cursed suit of armor, 
	however, offers poor protection and may sometimes be worse than no armor at 
	all.</p>
<p align="justify">
    After the player has identified a suit of armor, the protection bonus 
	appears before the armor's name in an inventory listing. If the bonus is 
	positive the armor is blessed, and if it is negative, the armor is usually 
	cursed. The player cannot remove a cursed suit of armor.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Some monsters can corrode armor when they hit it. If such a monster hits the 
	player when the player is wearing metal armor, the armor loses some of its 
	protection value, but the corrosion does not curse the armor.</p>
<h3 align="justify">8. POTIONS AND SCROLLS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The player can frequently find potions and scrolls in the dungeon. In any 
	given dungeon, the player can distinguish among the different types of 
	potions by a potion's color and among the different types of scrolls by a 
	scroll's name. Quaffing a potion or reading a scroll usually causes some 
	magical occurrence. Most potions and scrolls may be cursed or blessed.</p>
<h3 align="justify">9. RINGS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    The player can wear a maximum of eight rings, and they have a magical effect 
	on the player as long as they are worn. Some rings also speed up the 
	player's metabolism, making the player require food more often. Many rings 
	can be cursed or blessed, and the player cannot remove a cursed ring. The 
	player can distinguish among different types of rings by a ring's jewel.</p>
<h3 align="justify">10. WANDS AND STAVES</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Wands and staves affect the player's environment. The player can zap a wand 
	or staff at something and perhaps shoot a bolt of lightning at it or 
	teleport it away. All wands or staves of the same type are constructed with 
	the same type of wood. Some wands and staves may be cursed or blessed.</p>
<h3 align="justify">11. FOOD</h3>
<p>The player must be careful not to run out of food since moving through the 
dungeon fighting monsters consumes a lot of energy. Starving results in the 
player's fainting for increasingly longer periods of time, during which any 
nearby monster can attack the player freely. </p>
<h3 align="justify">12. GOLD</h3>
<p>Gold has one use in a dungeon: buying things. One can buy things in two ways, 
either in a trading post or from a quartermaster. A trading post is a place 
&quot;between levels&quot; of the dungeon and can be entered by stepping on the entrance. 
A quartermaster is a person who will sometimes appear and will try to sell the 
player some of his wares. These wares are never cursed and frequently blessed, 
though blessed goods cost more than normal goods. If the player chooses to buy 
one of the quartermaster's items, the quartermaster trades the item for the 
specified amount of gold and disappears. Attacking a quartermaster causes him to 
vanish without offering a trade. </p>
<h3 align="justify">13. MISCELLANEOUS MAGIC ITEMS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Miscellaneous items such as a pair of boots or a book may be found within 
	the dungeon. These items can usually be used to the player's advantage 
	(assuming they are not cursed). Some of these items can be worn, such as a 
	cloak, while others are to be used, such as a book.</p>
<h3 align="justify">14. ARTIFACTS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Some monsters down in the depths of the dungeon carry unique artifacts. The 
	game begins as a quest to retrieve one of these items. Each artifact appears 
	only on its owner's person.</p>
<h3 align="justify">15. TRAPS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    &nbsp;A variety of traps, including trap doors, bear traps, and sleeping 
	traps, are hidden in the dungeon. They remain hidden until sprung by a 
	monster or the player. A sprung trap continues to function, but since it is 
	visible, an intelligent monster is not likely to tread on it.</p>
<h3 align="justify">16. THE MONSTERS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Each monster except for the merchant quartermaster appears in a limited 
	range of dungeon levels. All monsters of the same type share the same 
	abilities; all giant rats, for example, can give the player a disease, and 
	all jackalweres can put the player to sleep. Monsters of the same type can 
	vary, however, such that one kobold may be much more difficult to kill than 
	another one. In general, the more difficult it is to kill a monster, the 
	more experience points the monster is worth.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Most monsters attack by biting and clawing, but some monsters carry weapons, 
	including such projectile weapons as short bows and crossbows, and some 
	monsters have breath weapons. These latter monsters can attack the player 
	from across a room or down a corridor.</p>
<p align="justify">
    Some monsters are more intelligent than others, and the more intelligent a 
	monster, the more likely that the monster will run away if it is about to 
	die. A fleeing monster will not attack the player unless cornered.</p>
<p align="justify">As the player moves down in the dungeon, the monsters get 
more powerful. Deep down in the dungeon there exist some one-of-a-kind monsters. 
These monsters are greatly feared. However, once a &quot;unique monster&quot; is killed, 
the player will not find another in the current dungeon.</p>
<h3 align="justify">17. OPTIONS</h3>
<p align="justify">
    Rogue has several options which may be set by the player:
</p>
<p>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="3" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" id="table5" cellspacing="3">
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">terse</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>Setting this Boolean option results in shorter messages appearing on 
		the top line of the screen.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">jump</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>Setting this Boolean option results in waiting until the player has 
		finished running to draw the player's path. Otherwise the game always 
		displays the path one step at a time.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">step</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>Setting this Boolean option results in most listings, such as an 
		inventory, appearing one item at a time on the top line of the screen. 
		When this option is not set, the game clears the screen, displays the 
		list, and then redraws the dungeon.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">flush</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>Setting this Boolean option results in flushing all type ahead 
		(pending) commands when the player encounters a monster.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">askme</td>
	    <td nowrap>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>Setting this Boolean option results in the game prompting the player 
		for a name upon encountering a new type of scroll, potion, ring, staff, 
		or wand.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">name</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>This string is the player's name and defaults to the player's 
		account name.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">fruit</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>This string identifies the player's favorite fruit, sometimes 
		encountered in the dungeon. It defaults to slime-mold.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">file</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>This string, which defaults to rogue.save, specifies the file to use 
		for saving the game.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">score</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>This string identifies the top-ten score file to use for the game.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	    <td valign="top">class</td>
	    <td>&nbsp;</td>
	    <td>This option specifies the character class of the rogue. It can be 
		set only in the ROGUEOPTS environment variable.</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</p>
<p align="justify">
    The player can set options at the beginning of a game via the ROGUEOPTS 
	environment variable. Naming a Boolean option sets it, and preceding the 
	Boolean option name by &quot;no&quot; clears it. The syntax &quot;stringoption=name&quot; sets a 
	string option to &quot;name.&quot; So setting ROGUEOPTS to &quot;terse, jump, nostep, 
	flush, askme, name=Ivan the Terrible, fruit=pomegranate&quot; would set the 
	terse, jump, flush, and askme Boolean options, clear the step Boolean 
	option, set the player's name to &quot;Ivan the Terrible,&quot; set the player's 
	favorite fruit to a pomegranate, and use the defaults for the save file and 
	the score file.</p>
<p align="justify">
    The player may change an option at any time during the game via the option 
	command, which results in a listing of the current options. Typing a new 
	value changes the option, a RETURN moves to the next option, a '-' moves to 
	the previous option, and an ESCAPE returns the player to the dungeon.</p>
<h3 align="justify">18. SCORING</h3>
<p>The player receives experience points for stealing items from monsters, 
turning monsters (a clerical ability), and killing monsters. When the player 
gets killed, the player's score equals the player's experience points. A player 
who quits gets a score equal to the player's experience points and gold. If the 
player makes it back up out of the dungeon, the player's score equals the 
player's experience points plus the gold the player carried and the gold 
received from selling the player's possessions. Rogue maintains a list of the 
top ten scores to date, together with the name of the player obtaining the 
score, the level where the player finished, and the manner in which the player 
ended the game.</p>
<h3 align="justify">19. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h3>
